        <h3>Characters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Star Butterfly</strong></li>
          <p>Princess Star Butterfly is the main protagonist of Star vs. the
            Forces of Evil. She is a teenage princess of the kingdom of Mewni
            (located in another dimension) sent to Earth by her parents in order
             to learn how to use the royal magic wand.
           </p>
           <p>Star has two main motivations</p>
           <ol>
             <li>Learning to control her wand</li>
             <li>Keeping the wand out of the wrong hands</li>
           </ol>
        <br>
          <li><strong>Marco Diaz</strong></li>
          <p>Marco is Star's best friend. He is kind, responsible,
            very organized, and supportive of others. He has a reputation at his
             school for being the "safe kid" due to avoiding danger and being
             cautious, though he insists that he is a "misunderstood bad boy".
          </p>
          <li><strong>Ludo</strong></li>
          <p>Ludo is a major antagonist of Star vs. the Forces of Evil.
            In season 1, he uses an army of monsters in order to steal Star's
            wand and take over the universe. As of season 2, however, he has his
             own wand and new monster followers. Toward the end of season 2, his
              body is possessed by Toffee.
